# MsaProject

🕌 MSA Campus Hub – A centralized web platform built for the Muslim Student Association (MSA) to streamline campus-wide engagement.

The MSA Campus Hub is a full-featured web platform built to meet the real-world needs of Muslim Student Associations. Its mission is to empower MSAs with a professional, easy-to-use online space where members can access prayer schedules, stay updated on events, volunteer, learn about Islam, and strengthen their community — all from one place.

This project is designed to be scalable and customizable for any university or organization looking to modernize their MSA communication and activity management. It blends spiritual utility, community-building features, and engaging content into one cohesive and beautiful experience.
