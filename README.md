🕌 MSA Campus Hub – A centralized web platform built for the Muslim Student Association (MSA) to streamline campus-wide engagement.

The MSA Campus Hub is a full-featured web platform built to meet the real-world needs of Muslim Student Associations. Its mission is to empower MSAs with a professional, easy-to-use online space where members can access prayer schedules, stay updated on events, volunteer, learn about Islam, and strengthen their community — all from one place.
